# DSCL-EXP-Add-Linked-LIST
Description : This C program implements a singly linked list with the ability to add a new node at the end of the list and display the contents of the list.

Algorithm:

Define a struct node with two members, an integer data and a pointer to the next node. Create a start pointer to the first node in the linked list. Create a newnode pointer, allocate memory to it and initialize the data and next members. Assign the newnode pointer to the start pointer. Display the contents of the list using the display() function. Call the addatend() function to add a new node at the end of the list. Display the contents of the list again using the display() function.

Output: The output of this program displays the contents of the linked list before and after adding a new node at the end.

first node added successfully data = 1, self addr = 123456, next addr = 0 Enter data: 2 data = 1, self addr = 123456, next addr = 789012 data = 2, self addr = 789012, next addr = 0
